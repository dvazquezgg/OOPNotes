## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher)

## Downloading the Code

Follow these steps to download the project code from GitHub:

1. **Go to the GitHub repository**  
   Visit the link to the repository: [OOP Notes Project](https://github.com/dvazquezgg/OOPNotes)

2. **Download as ZIP**  
   - Click the green `Code` button near the top-right of the page.
   - Select `Download ZIP` from the dropdown menu.
   - The ZIP file will now download to your computer.

3. **Extract the ZIP file**  
   - Locate the downloaded ZIP file in your Downloads folder.
   - Right-click the file and select `Extract All...` or use an extraction tool to unzip the folder.

## Setting up the Project in IntelliJ IDEA

Follow these step-by-step instructions to create a new project using the extracted code:

1. **Open IntelliJ IDEA**  
   If you haven't installed IntelliJ yet, please follow the download instructions from the [IntelliJ IDEA website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

2. **Create a New Project**  
   - On the Welcome screen, click `Open` (or select `File > Open` from the menu bar if you already have another project open).
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the ZIP file and select the project folder. Click `OK` to open it.

3. **Configure the JDK**  
   If IntelliJ prompts you to set up the JDK:
   - Click `Configure JDK` in the pop-up message.
   - Select the JDK version you installed earlier or click `Download JDK` if necessary.

4. **Import Project Settings**  
   When prompted to import project settings, select `Import Project from Existing Sources` and click `Next`.

5. **Build the Project**  
   - IntelliJ will now index and build the project.
   - Wait for the process to complete. Any required dependencies will automatically be downloaded.

## Running the Code

To run the project code:

1. **Locate the Main Class**  
   - In the `Project` pane on the left, find the file that contains the `main` method (this is usually named something like `Main.java`).

2. **Run the Program**  
   - Right-click the file and select `Run 'Main'` from the menu.
   - The output of your program will appear in the `Run` console at the bottom of the screen.

## Additional Notes

- If you encounter any issues during setup, try closing IntelliJ and reopening the project. Make sure that all required files are correctly downloaded.
- For further help or troubleshooting, refer to the official [IntelliJ IDEA documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/).
